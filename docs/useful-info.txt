Other notes:
- Ensure that the linear speed is high enough when turning at sharp angles, or the car may behave unexpectedly
    - For example: If the linear speed = 0.1 m/s, trying to turn right with angular speed > 0.3 rad/s triggers some internal mechanism to automatically turn the wheels to the left and skid instead.
- On the raspberry pi, ROS2 is installed within a docker container
    - To access docker through SSH: docker exec -it jetacker_pi /bin/bash
    - To copy files from outside the docker container to inside it: docker cp path-to-file jetacker_pi:path-to-destination
- As far as I know, the car cannot connect to the internet. To copy files to the car so they’re accessible within the ROS system, copy as follows: 
    - Computer → raspberry pi → docker container
